## Overview
This repository gathers **my individual contributions** to different team-based projects developed during training activities.  
It does **not** represent the full applications — only the parts I personally implemented.

Each folder contains the code related to **one specific module** I worked on, such as:

- **RSS Feed API (STJ)** → Node.js + Express + AWS S3 for saving and retrieving processed data  
- **Invoice Data Extraction** → AWS Textract + Python NLP prototypes  
- **Chatbot LLM Module** → Bedrock-based LLM prototyping using LangChain  

These modules were later integrated into larger team projects, and therefore **future adjustments made to the full applications may not be included here**.

## Structure

```

├── rss-stj-api/ # My part of the RSS STJ API (frontend + Express + S3)
├── invoice-processor/ # My Textract + NLP invoice extraction modules
├── chatbot-llm/ # My chatbot LLM prototypes (Bedrock + LangChain)
└── README.md # This file
```

## Purpose
This repository serves as a **portfolio of the portions I developed**, showing:
- API building  
- OCR + NLP processing  
- LLM / RAG prototyping  
- Frontend interaction logic  
- AWS cloud integration  

## Note
Because these were collaborative projects, this repository includes **only my scoped contributions**, not full systems.
